# Hand-written-character-recognization
Handwritten Character Recognition

Project Idea: In this machine learning project, we will detect & recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. We are going to achieve by modelling a neural network.

Project Prerequisites
Below are the prerequisites for this project:
1.	Python (3.7.4 used)
2.	IDE (Jupyter used)

Required frameworks are
1.	Numpy (version 1.16.5)
2.	cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
3.	Keras (version 2.3.1)
4.	Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
5.	Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)
6.	Pandas (version 0.25.1)
